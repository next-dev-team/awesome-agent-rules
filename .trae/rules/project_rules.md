# Operational Guidelines: STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED

## Project Overview

A project launcher that replaces itself with the chosen IDE is much more efficient than embedding. This approach eliminates the performance overhead while solving your workflow problem perfectly.

Benefits of This Approach
✅ Zero performance overhead - launcher closes when IDE opens
✅ Seamless transition - appears at same position
✅ Native IDE experience - no embedding limitations
✅ Memory efficient - only one app running at a time
✅ Fast switching - quick project selection
✅ Extensible - easy to add new IDEs
