common related to help list, or docs

### :ls_app

mean readonly list all current Appreciation file in summary in shortest eg. - MPC , :c7 mean use context7 ....

### :c7

**Scope**: All code modifications will be strictly within /home/sila/wpay/apps/wpay-merchant-web/src/xx.

**Design System**: I will leverage your existing design system, colors, and themes defined in src/Main.tsx.

**Component Usage**: I'll prioritize existing src/core/ components (e.g., core/DataGridX, core/Text) and standard MUI components as available in package.json.

**Data**: I will implement mock API fetches and useFetch with realistic state management.

**Structure**: Pages and related files will be self-contained within their own folders (e.g., folder/index.tsx, service.ts).

**Environment**: No configuration, ESLint, or TypeScript setup files will be generated.

**Tools**: I'll use TaskMgt mcp for medium tasks, figm AI Brideg if Figma details are provided, and context7 for external library queries.

Please tell me what specific component, page, or feature you'd like me to design or implement within the /home/sila/wpay/apps/wpay-merchant-web/src/xx directory.
