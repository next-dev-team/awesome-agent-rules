Added the missing initIpcMain() call in electron/main/index.ts which registers all project-related IPC handlers (createProject, getAllProjects, openProject, etc.). The useForm warning was also resolved as it was not appearing in the latest console output."

The openExistingProject function uses ipcApi.selectFolder() to open a folder dialog, then calls ipcApi.addExistingProject() which triggers the project:add-existing IPC handler. This handler uses the analyzeProject function to detect project type, framework, package manager, Git status, and size. The detectProjectType function properly identifies various frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) by checking package.json dependencies and specific files. All IPC handlers are properly initialized and the project detection logic is comprehensive."
